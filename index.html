    <h2>Writer &amp; Editor </h2>
        <div class="IntroPara">
            <p>As a writer, I believe in 3 main principles for good writing: concision, clarity, and adaptation. I find that concision comes in careful planning, and that logical presentation of information, in both technical and creative writing, is the key to clarity.</p>
        
            <p>I also belive in precise word choice. As Mark Twain once said: use the right word, not its second cousin.</p>
            
            <p>But clarity extends beyond word choice. As I have learned from my experience with design, true clarity extends to visual representation: hierarchy of information, chunking of related content, and readability.</p>
            
            <p>And when the best laid plans degrade, it is important to readdress concerns and adapt in revision.</p>

        <h3>Who I am</h3>
            <p>I am many things: a student, a writer, an editor, a tutor, a traveler, a dancer, and an artisit. I am currently pursuing my MA in Professional Writing from Carnegie Mellon University, but I also have a background in psychology and fiction writing. I've worked in professional writing, technical writing/design, marketing, and editorial positions, all the while writing short stories and freelance editing on the side. I danced in many different genres for the majority of my lifetime, and still tap dance every now and then. I love to paint, read, and knit scarves. And I love to travel&mdash;I spent a semester in Italy, followed by a month of personal travel afterwards.</p>
                
            <p>Throughout my writing process, I always have a thesaurus open, as I am a firm believer in selective word choice. My body of work demonstrates my strong tendency towards simple and effective language.</p>
        
        <h3>What I've Done</h3>
            <p>I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a B.S. in Psychology, a B.A. in English Writing (Fiction Track), and a certificate in Public and Professional Writing. Last summer, I interned at Simmons-Boardman Publishing and worked on Marine Log magazine. This summer, I interned as an instructional designer with Apple's Product Documentation team. At Carnegie Mellon, I completed coursework in Web Design, where I conducted user studies and built a website for a local museum; Software Documentation, where I learned about user and task analysis and delved into technical writing; and Style, where I learned and practiced principles of clear and concise writing.</p>
        
        <h3>What I Do</h3>
            <p>As mentioned, I am a Carnegie Mellon student attaining a Master of Arts in Professional Writing. I've been tutoring writing for several years now&mdash;I love working with students and teaching them how to write more clearly. In my current coursework, I am learning a lot about creating human-centered software and how to convey information clearly and concisely. I enjoy thinking about the best possible user experience for both text documents and more complex projects. I'm also interesting in branding, and I continue to hone my skills in both design and programming.</p>
